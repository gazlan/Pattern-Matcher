   Pattern matching is a powerful tool for syntax analysis. The main idea of
   pattern matching comes from the SNOBOL4 language (see the wonderful book THE
   SNOBOL4 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE by R. E. Griswold, J. F. Poage and I. P.
   Polonsky). Some of the pattern expression atoms and statements were taken from
   there. One can find that patterns are very similar to the Backus-Naur forms.
   Comparing with the regular expressions (used by grep and egrep in UNIX)
   patterns are more powerful, but slower in matching.
